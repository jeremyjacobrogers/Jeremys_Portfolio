<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 100% disabled veteran of the Unites States Army Ranger Regiment, 1st Ranger Battalion.
  I have an Associates Degree in Computer Science, a Bachelors degree in Psychology and working on my MDiv.
  Programming is my passion and I find nothing more rewarding other than being a father of 3. I turn 49 years old in a few days
  and I fully believe it is never too late to start something new.

</p>

<p>I am taking Angela Yu's fullstack bootcamp in hopes of bettering myself and finding a good career. I am personally tired of living off of disability and I figure with my knowledge and determination
  I can do great things with my life. I am a hard worker and strive for excellence. I never give up as quit is not a Ranger word. 
  I will continue until I complete my mission, though I be the lone survivor.

<p>This is my very first portfolio project and it is a very simple and basic html webpage. It drives my crazy when people say that html is a programming language.
  I have studied PHP, Javascript, and Python and I absolutely love backend development. However; I am learning that frontend can be very fun as well.
  Like I said this is a very basic, 90's style webpage built solely in html without css or Js.
